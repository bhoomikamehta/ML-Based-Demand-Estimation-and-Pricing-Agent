# Dynamic Pricing Agent with Competitive Strategy

Built an ML-driven pricing agent that optimizes revenue under inventory constraints and real-time competition. 
Part 1 uses a Gradient Boosting model (ROC-AUC: 0.994) with a dynamic threshold policy for inventory management. 
Part 2 extends this with a Neural Network demand model and opponent-aware pricing using Ridge Regression, 
implementing a tit-for-tat cooperation mechanism to avoid price-undercutting cycles.
